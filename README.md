# EncryptedFolderDefender
Vigilant Wipe is a self-destructive folder security tool that triggers after three failed password attempts. It securely backs up selected files via email, then permanently wipes sensitive data. Running silently in the background, itâ€™s ideal for protecting confidential files from unauthorized access or physical device theft.
